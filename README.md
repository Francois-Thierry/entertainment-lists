If you want to make your own database, you have to download this repository AND [THE ASSETS DIRECTORY](https://github.com/Francois-Thierry/francois-thierry.github.io) and correct the links in index.html (i.e. links with src="../assets/...") with the new relative path of the assets folder. After that you should be able to run the project locally.
